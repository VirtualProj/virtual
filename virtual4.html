		<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">A toy gun 
		resembling a 9mm carbine was brought from the local toy shop. The weapon 
		was opened and all parts that were not required were removed. Both the 
		PCB from the gyro mouse were suitably mounted inside this weapon. The 
		MG110 gyro needs to be removed.&nbsp; The proximity sensor was replaced by a 
		fixed 100k resistor, leaving the LED side blank. The components for 
		optical mouse were disconnected by following the wiring on the PCB. The 
		scan button for the SPI wireless transceiver from Cyprus semiconductor 
		was ohmed out and a separate switch was fixed in its place. The channel 
		once fixed will generally not get shifted on its own but a scan button 
		was provided on the outside of the gun in case this happens. A 2mm 
		inline connector was made to join both the PCB together. The charging 
		PCB was removed from the charging cradle and modified to be fitted 
		inside the gun. The onboard voltage regulating device was used for 
		connecting the battery to the charger. Initially an independent voltage 
		regulator was used but was deemed not required after the drop across the 
		resistance was able to bring the charging voltage to within limits of 
		the Li-on battery pack. The charger used presently is not very fast and 
		a faster charger for Li-on pack can be used to replace the current one.
		</span></p>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">The MG110 
		Gyro module needs to be taken out to be fitted into the barrel of the 
		gun. A 2 DOF accelerometer needs to be used to correct drift errors in 
		the gyro by providing a stable reference bias. After all modifications 
		were completed the weapon was closed and made ready for testing. During 
		testing we found the device easily mapped to the screen pixels. We 
		recommend using a PIC controller with a SPI interface to read the MG110 
		data and accelerometer data and then performing adaptive Kalman 
		filtering at the microcontroller level and integrating the output&nbsp; to a 
		Cypress wireless module transceiver. This input can be received&nbsp; at the 
		other end by a similar transceiver module and fed to a PIC controller 
		with USB interface. The Controller can then implement a mouse or a 
		virtual serial port to read the data. </span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">After

		and fixed to a trigger mechanism. The switch was connected to one of the 
		programmable buttons. It is recommended that a robust leaf switch be 
		used in place of the present switch used as the trigger isoperated all 
		the time. The cue from the button was subsequently used to indicate 
		trigger press and used in a home brewn game. The fig below shows the 
		completed gun. </span></p>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">The 
		battery charging circuit was also modified. There are additional 
		programmable buttons available that can be used to indicate magazine 
		fitment, cocking and other indicators for a state of the art military 
		training simulator. There is also a rotary encoder available that can 
		also be used for deriving cues for the virtual environment. If 
		additional functionality is desired the MG110 gyro module can be removed 
		from this PCB and implemented using a different microcontroller such as 
		a RCM module from rabbit semiconductor that has an RTOS and many more 
		advanced features for extended I/O and robust design. </span></p>

		<span style="font-family:Arial">Sensors' measurements or data need to be 
		properly interpreted, processed and fused in order to generate refined 
		navigation information. The model-based Kalman filter and the model-free 
		artificial intelligence (AI) methods are two different data processing 
		and data fusion techniques. The Kalman filter offers a powerful method 
		for linear data fusion and estimation that are optimal in the 
		statistical sense if the system models are known. AI methods including 
		fuzzy logic and neural networks provide a nonlinear mechanism for 
		high-level inference, data classification, and functional mapping.</span></p>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><b><u>
		<span style="font-size:13.5pt;font-family:
Arial">Kalman Filter</span></u></b></p>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">The Kalman 
		filter is a linear recursive data processing algorithm that processes 
		all available measurements, regardless of their precision, to estimate 
		the current value of the variables of interest, with use of&nbsp; knowledge 
		of the system and measurement device dynamics, the statistical 
		description of the system noises, measurement errors, and&nbsp;uncertainty in 
		the dynamics models, and available information about initial conditions 
		of the variables of interest. If the input data fits the predefined 
		linear dynamics and statistical models and prior knowledge is known, the 
		Kalman filter can provide an optimal, in a minimum variance sense, 
		estimate of the state vector. Accordingly, the Kalman filter has become 
		the most common technique for estimating the state of a linear system 
		particularly in navigation systems. Since the estimation process is 
		implemented on a computer, the discrete form of the Kalman filter is 
		generally used. </span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">The 
		concept of fuzzy logic was first conceived by Zadeh (1965). As the 
		complexity of a system increases, it becomes more difficult to make a 
		precise statement about its behavior and fuzzy logic provides a 
		framework to deal with such problems naturally (Zadeh, 1965). Resembling 
		human decision making by using if-then rules and handling ambiguous and 
		imprecise information by using fuzzy set theory, fuzzy logic provides a 
		successful way of dealing with complex systems. Fuzzy logic has found 
		successful applications in decision making, data classification, pattern 
		recognition, automatic control and etc.</span></p>

		fuzzy interface system to get&nbsp;classification data. It is realised that 
		the traditional approach of using only Kalman filtering is insufficient 
		for a highly precise system but in the present case it is not required 
		but if we desire highly accurate inertial data then we need to use
