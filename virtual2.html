		<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">During the last decade, low-cost 
		Micro-Electro-Mechanical-System (MEMS) based inertial sensors have been 
		steadily emerging into the market place. Their miniature design and 
		lightweight result in many advantages such as low power consumption, 
		wide bandwidth, and survivability. Their costs are low and are easier to

		<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">The goal of this chapter is henceforth to 
		evaluate MEMS technology to be used for VR type applications. The

		<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">Errors of MEMS-based inertial sensor 
		measurements can be classified into two categories based on their 
		ability to be determined or modelled: </font> </p>
		<ol start="1" type="1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
			<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
			<font face="Arial">First, 
			deterministic errors due to large bias and drift values and their 
			relatively wide variation with surrounding environmental conditions, 
			particularly temperature. The variation of the sensor bias can take 
			place either during the same run, known as in-run bias instability, 
			or from turn on to another namely run-to-run or turn-on-to-turn-on 
			bias instability. Part of the in-run sensor bias instability, most 
			probably caused by the variation of environmental conditions, is 
			also deterministic and can be quantified or modeled based on 
			intensive and careful lab testing. Nevertheless, the remaining part 
			is hard to model and thus is considered as a random or stochastic 
			part, which belongs to the second error category. </font> </li>
			<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
			<font face="Arial">Second, stochastic 
			errors due to the relatively high noise level accompanying the 
			output measurements of MEMS sensors. This output noise introduces 
			short-term errors with frequency ranges coinciding with that of the 
			motion of interest beside those caused by secondary dynamics and 
			hand vibrations in kinematics mode. Stochastic errors also arise 
			from the random part of the in-run instability of sensor biases as 
			well as the run-to-run bias instability. Short-term data errors from 
			the inertial systems IS are relatively small and less noisy, but 
			they degrade rapidly without bound over time. Therefore we require 
			some very accurate external measurement data for updating the IS 
			with data pointers, thus improving its long-term accuracy. UI for 
			visualizing errors by observing the waveforms are presented in fig

		Inertial position Sensors </span></u></b></font></p>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">The operation of an inertial navigation 
		system follows the laws of classical mechanics as formulated by Newton. 
		Newton's first law states &quot;Every body continues in its state of rest, or 
		uniform motion in a straight line, unless it is compelled to change that 
		state by forces impressed on it&quot;. Newton's second law states that&quot;Acceleration is proportional to the resultant force and is in the 
		same direction as this force &quot;which translates to: </font> </p>
		<p align="center" style="text-align:center"><font face="Arial"><b>
		<span style="font-size: 13.5pt">F = ma = mf + mg</span></b></font></p>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">Here <b><span style="font-size: 13.5pt">f
		</span></b>is the acceleration produced by the force <b>
		<span style="font-size: 13.5pt">F </span></b>other than the 
		gravitational field. The acceleration <b>
		<span style="font-size: 13.5pt">a </span></b>may be expressed as the 
		total force per unit mass and <b><span style="font-size: 13.5pt">g
		</span></b>is the gravitational force. In case of a unit mass, the above 
		equation becomes: </font> </p>
		<p align="center" style="text-align:center"><font face="Arial"><b>
		<span style="font-size: 13.5pt">F = a = f +g</span></b></font></p>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">Given the ability to measure acceleration 
		using an accelerometer, it is possible to calculate the change in 
		velocity and position by performing successive mathematical integrations 
		of the acceleration with respect to time. An Inertial system (<b>IS) </b>
		usually contains three accelerometers, placed perpendicularly to one 
		another, each of which is capable of detecting acceleration in a single 
		direction. In order to navigate with respect to the inertial reference 
		frame, it is necessary to keep track of the direction(s) in which the 
		accelerometers are pointing. Rotational motion of a body with respect to 
		the inertial reference frame may be sensed using gyroscopic sensors and 
		can therefore be used to determine the orientation of the accelerometers 
		at all times. Given this information, it is possible to project the 
		accelerations into the reference frame before the integration process 
		takes place. Conventional gyroscopes make use of the inertial properties 
		of a rotating wheel, or rotor, spinning at high speed .Hence, inertial 
		tracking is the process whereby the measurements provided by the 
		accelerometers and gyroscopes are used to determine the position of the 
		object in which they are installed. By combining the two sets of 
		measurements, it is possible to define the translational motion of the 
		object within the inertial reference frame and hence to calculate the 
		position within that frame </font> </p>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">In order to ensure the appropriateness of 
		an IS for a specific application, the application's performance 
		requirements have to be fulfilled. The overall performance of an 
		inertial navigation sensor is determined through accumulating the 
		performances of individual inertial sensors involved in the system. This 
		can be achieved in turn by quantifying the parameters or characteristics 
		describing the performance of each particular inertial sensor through a 
		series of lab tests. The most important among those characteristics are: 
		bias, scale factor, output stability, thermal sensitivity, magnetic 
		sensitivity, centrifuge, shock survivability, effect of vibrations, as

		<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">Three dual axis accelerometers could be 
		used to measure all 6 degrees of freedom. Taking the difference between 
		the measurements observed by the accelerometer based opposite to each 
		other can differentiate rotation and translation from each other: 
		&quot;rotation can be measured inertially without gyroscopes, using the 
		differential linear accelerations measured by two (or more) 
		accelerometers undergoing the same rotational motion but located at 
		different distances from the center of rotation,&quot; fig below. Using 
		accelerometers in this configuration involves complex mathematics to 
		track and subtract the effect of gravity. </font> </p>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">For this reason it was decided to use 
		gyroscopes to measure rotation and 3 single axis accelerometers to 
		measure translation. This simplifies the task of removing the component 
		of gravity because the orientation of the device is known from the gyros 
		(which do not sense gravity like accelerometers). It was also decided 
		that for a game simulator roll is not very important hence a 2DOF MEMS 
		gyro giving Pitch and Yaw will suffice, similarly since the movement of 
		the controller will not be too much towards the screen we can also do 
		away with a 3DOF accelerometer and instead use a 2DOF MEMS accelerometer 
		that gives us x, y displacement. This will in reality give us a 4DOF 
		sensor as opposed to 6DOF inducing some negligible errors in 3D position 
		of a point in space, which are not very important from our VR gaming 
		device point of view. </font> </p>

		<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">Gyroscopes can be used to measure the 
		angular velocity around the three axis x, y and z (roll, pitch and yaw 
		respectively). Gyroscopes do not suffer the effects of gravity like 
		accelerometers, so they can be used to sense orientation and track 
		gravity. 3 single-axis accelerometers can be used in conjunction with 
		gyroscopes to measure translation. One major advantage of using 
		gyroscopes to measure roll, pitch and yaw, then adding x, y and z 
		translation using accelerometers reduces complexity in the project. 
		Forming a complex solution using accelerometers alone carries the risk 
		that either everything or nothing will work. </font> </p>
