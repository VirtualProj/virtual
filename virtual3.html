		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">We 
		implemented several software's to test out our implementations. The 
		choice of development environment was Microsoft Visual Studio as it 
		provides a visual development environment where the debugging is 
		relatively easy. We used a mix match of various languages such as Ansi 
		C, Visual basic and Visual C++ in our implementations. We also tried to 
		C Sharp for some test UI. </span></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Since 
		our operating system was primarily Windows XP direct port addressing was 
		not permitted due to layered access control model of the operating 
		system. Therefore either we had to resort to built-in drivers from 
		available windows libraries or write our own drivers using the Windows 
		NT DDK. We managed to get the windows DDK from our MSDNAA site as also 
		most of the development tools. Our initial attempts to write drivers for 
		the serial, parallel and the USB ports was met by failure as we did not 
		have enough experience in writing such drivers and no clear help was 
		available from any quarters. We further explored our development 
		environment of choice and found that an earlier version of Visual Basic 
		had a serial port drive library component which was absent in the later 
		versions of the same product. Why it was removed is not known. We 
		managed to get a kernel mode driver called the buzz driver from the net 
		for parallel port and converted it into a windows DLL library. We also 
		found that there were several other options such as TOTALIO available 
		from Dr Dobbs journal 1999 and GIVEIO an open source, source-forge 
		project. Our search of the net further revealed that TOTALIO was very 
		dangerous to use as it tampered the access control mechanism of the 
		operating system and very often led to unrecoverable system crashes as 
		also hardware damage. The other option was to use GIVEIO. It is a 
		modification of TOTALIO and is somewhat safer than TOTALIO but sometimes 
		does not work with specific motherboards or chip controllers. Therefore 
		we decided to use windows DDK and code available from Jan Axelsons 
		Lakeview Research website to create a widow's driver library of our own. 
		This isused for parallel port I/O if required. For USB we will have to 
		use the chip manufacturer's HID stack and the SDK provided to create a 
		suitable driver. Fortunately for us we managed to get a ready-made 
		driver for the Zigbee implementation from Texas instruments. </span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">On going 
		through the documentation of the ZSTAR implementation it was realised 
		that the USB device could emulate a serial port and will send all data 
		through this port to the PC. The ZSTAR implementation can also act as a 
		tilt mouse. To get data from the ZSTAR module commands needed to be sent 
		to the module first and in response to which the ZSTAR implementation 
		will send certain string of data. To validate and see the data and check 
		the response of the accelerometer to change in acceleration in the 
		various axis a GUI was made using Microsoft Mscomm component and VB6. A 
		snapshot of the component created is shown in fig below. A common 
		utility such as a HyperTerminal could have also been used for this 
		purpose but in trying to make our own software we will make our first 
		attempt at actually trying to use this device. </span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">The Gyro

		based on a tiny embedded gyroscope that can measure the angle and speed 
		of movement to advance a cursor between Point A and B. The unit is 
		programmed with a sophisticated set of patented motion control 
		algorithms, power management features and integration capabilities that 
		allow quick and low cost implementation of motion sensing technology 
		into a range of applications. Advanced units have five degrees of motion 
		sensing freedom -two rotational (gyroscope) axes and three linear 
		(accelerometer) axes - roll and dynamic drift compensation, lower power 
		consumption and fast start up times (20ms). We implemented a small 
		screen tracking utility using code provided in Microsoft Direct X SDK to

		</span></i></b></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">We 
		decided to make our first application that will rotate a cube depending 
		on the orientation of the accelerometer. We wanted a GUI to simulate the 
		cube, record data both when simulating using an analog input by means of 
		potentiometer and rotating the cube by the accelerometer. Our 
		application was made in such a manner that change in orientation of 
		accelerometer beyond a certain minimal value isrequired to actually tilt 
		the cube. This was done to compensate for noise induced due to vibration 
		and involuntary movements of the human hand. A calibration control was 
		added to set parameters such as sensitivity to change in orientation, 
		damping the signal automatically, amplification, setting the max output 
		at degree/sec for angular velocity etc was added. Bars were added to 
		visually see the input signal, signal being processesed and the output 
		signal going to the cube simulator. Provision was also provided to 
		manually simulate the cube with the help of sliders which acted as 
		analog potentiometers. </span></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">This UI 
		was built initially when it was not thought that a 3DOF accelerometer is 
		made available as the 3DOF technology in a single package was relatively 
		new and not easily accessible so a 2DOF simulator was created. It will 
		only mean duplicating the code for an additional axis of the cube. A 
		snapshot of the UI is shown below in fig. The ZSTAR reference design 
		will now be used for simulation of VR hand that will give it orientation 
		information to control and handle virtual objects in say a game or an 
		advanced simulation. The UI uses code from various open source sites 
		with many minor to major modifications. A very large portion of the code 
		was written in house for this simulation. We also stumbled upon 
		libraries which are called source code libraries which provide small 
		snippets of error free code which can be used quite easily. One such 
		library from OverZone software was referred to. A trial ware is 
		available from their website. </span></p>

		simulation </span></u></b></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">We tried 
		to create a VR glove which when worn by an individual on the hand will 
		mimic the movement of the fingers of the hand in an application which 
		requires object handling and also provide hand orientation movement 
		using MEMS accelerometers. This UI also like the previous UI has a 
		simulation interface and a control interface. With the simulation 
		interface you can manipulate the virtual hand to see its movements in 
		the absence of any signals from external sensors. The fingers are also 
		segmented to provide as close to real fingers movements as possible. It 
		is also possible to increase the number of segments so that the movement 
		become smooth or the implementation can be in such a way the movement is 
		per segment of finger. Textures have not been applied to the hand but 
		can be applied to give a glove or a real hand appearance depending on 
		the application. </span></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">
		Knowledge acquired in making the previous applications was used in 
		realising this project and many code parts from previous projects were 
		used leading to code reuse. The basic idea of the hand and code snippet 
		on the movement of the finger was taken from a Spanish website that I 
		did not quite understand, since programs have no language barriers I was 
		able to understand the method used and enhanced the snippet to create a 
		hand with finger movements. Coding for the AVR series of 
		microcontrollers for the kit provided by the embedded systems lab was 
		done in house. Help on code snippets was taken from AVR freaks and other 
		such websites. </span></p>

		microcontroller did not work out due to paucity of time, we will have 
		some implementation ready. However for this we will require good quality 
		miniature proximity sensors. The software implementation is shown in fig 
		below. Like the other GUI this also contains a simulator part though
